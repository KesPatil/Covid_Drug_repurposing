# Covid_Drug_repurposing
This is my attempt to find repurposed drugs against COVID using computational techniques. NOTE: This is strictly an academic exercise and the results are totally not relevant to any clinical application. 

The question that I am trying to answer here is whether there can be anti-COVID drugs that can be suitable to patients with an already existing condition like 
alzheimers, parkinson or diabetes. 

The idea here is to check if certain drugs could be clustered together based on structural similarity and if results could be inferred to answer the above question.
